You have hope that you will only take care of her until your best friend comes back home. The government oppresses undocumented immigrants and you find it necessary to use your privilege to continue helping your best friend and her child. They have always supported you through good and bad times. You will make sacrifices to help her child emotionally and financially. Although you are overwhelmed with the responsibilities, you realize that it will be worth it in the end. As the weeks pass by, you continue taking care of the child and begin your challenging journey to help your best friend come back home to her child.</p>
